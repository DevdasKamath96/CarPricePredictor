# CarPricePredictor

This is a simple model created using Random forest regressor to predict the selling price of the second hand car depending on the number of kms driven,type of fuel,
whether the car is being sold by dealer or the owner, whether it is an automatic or manual car and also the current price of the car.

A simple web app is created using HTML template and Flask is used to implement the backend section of the application.
